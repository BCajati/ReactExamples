# ReactExamples - 4/3/2021
Holds my learning examples so I can easily refer back to them
Starting this as one repo that can hold my react examples.
Started with some basic bootstrap so that I can use navigation and have some default CSS that looks decent.

Still very preliminary at this point.
Beginner Project - Date Reminders. Display and add birthday/anniversay reminders - In Progress.
